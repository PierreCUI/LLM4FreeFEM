# Problem Description #

This problem solves a shape-optimization problem for a diffusion equation, aiming to minimize the objective functional J by modifying the domain shape. The system is represented by the tempeture field u. The parameter being solved for is the shape itself, represented by the level-set function phi(x).

# Governing Equation and Variables #

The process is governed by the partial differential equation: -div(lambda * chi(x) * grad u(x)) = f, with chi(x) the characteristic function. The problem is defined within 2 dimensions, thus x and y.

Constants:
	lambda: diffusion coefficient,
	f: source term.
	
# Boundary Conditions #
	
Dirichlet boundary:
    u = 0 on boundary labeled as 3.

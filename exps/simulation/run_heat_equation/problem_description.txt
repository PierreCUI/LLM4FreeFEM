# Problem Description #

This problem studies a transient heat conduction process defined over a spatial domain Omega. The objective is to compute the time–dependent unknown temperature field u(x, t).

# Governing Equation and Variables #

The process is governed by the partial differential equation: c * (du/dt) - div(k * grad(u)) = f in Omega. The problem is defined within 2 dimensions, thus x and y. uold is the solution from the previous time step.

Constants:
    k: thermal conductivity,
    c: heat capacity,
    f: heat source strength,
	timeStepSize: the temporal increment for the simulation.

# Boundary Conditions #

Dirichlet boundary:
    u = 0 on boundary labeled as 1.

1. Constant Values
The following scalar constants are defined in the script:
	- diffusion coefficient k = 1,
	- heat inertia: c = 3,
	- source term amplitude f = 4.

2. Mesh
The computational domain is a unit square divided into a regular grid with nn = 20 and is labeled as [1, 2, 3, 4].

3. Iteration Times
The for loop should iterate from 0 until finalTime = 10, with a step size of timeStepSize = 0.1.

4. Space
u is defined within P1 space.

# This is a document to provide extra information for the training process #

1. Constant Values
The following scalar constants are defined in the script:
    - fluid density: rho = 1,
    - dynamic viscosity: mu = 1.827e-2,
    - penalty parameter: gamma = 1.0e-9.

2. Mesh
The computational domain is defined by a unit square, and it is discretized using n = 40 segments, and with a transformation [x, (0.1+0.1*x)*y + 4*x^2*(1-x)^2]. This mesh is then saved. A 2d mesh adaptation is performed by "mmg2d" commend, refining the mesh so that no element exceeds a maximum size of 0.0025. Read back the mesh by covering directly the old mesh's variable. No label is required.

3. Iteration Times
The for loop should iterate from 0 until 40. Early stop if rhs.linfty is smaller than 1e-6 and sol.linfty is smaller than 1e-5.

4. Initial field
The initial speed is defined as y*(y-0.1)*(x<0.0005) at vx, and 0 at vy. The pressure is 0 at initial.

5. Space
v is defined within P2 space, p is defined within P1 space.

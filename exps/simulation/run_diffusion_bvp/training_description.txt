1. Constant Values
The following scalar constants are defined in the script:
	- diffusion coefficient: k = 1,
	- mass / reaction term: m = 1,
	- source term amplitude: f = 4.

2. Mesh
The computational domain is a unit square. This domain is divided into a regular grid with nn = 20. It is labeled by [1, 2, 3, 4].

3. Space
T is defined within P1 space.

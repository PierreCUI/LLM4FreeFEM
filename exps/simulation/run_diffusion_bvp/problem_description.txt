# Problem Description #

This problem studies a steady-state diffusion heat conduction process defined over a spatial domain Omega. The objective is to compute the spatial distribution of an unknown field T(x). The formulation includes a complex term mass contribution.

# Governing Equation and Variables #

The process is governed by the complex partial differential equation: -div(k * grad(T)) + (m + 0.1*i) * T = f in Omega. The problem is defined within 2 dimensions, thus x and y.

Constants:
    k: diffusion coefficient,
    m: mass/reaction coefficient,
    f: source strength.

# Boundary Conditions #

Dirichlet boundary:
    T = 0 on boundary labeled as 1.

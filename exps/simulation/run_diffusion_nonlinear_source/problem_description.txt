# Problem Description #

This problem considers a stationary diffusion system on a spatial domain Omega. The objective is to compute the fields T(x) and u(x).

# Governing Equations #

The process is governed by the partial differential equation: -div(k * grad(T)) = f(T, u) in Omega and -div(k * grad(u)) = T in Omega with f(T, u) = f0 / (1 + T^2 + sin(u)). The problem is defined within 2 dimensions, thus x and y.

Constants:
	k: diffusion coefficient,
	f: nonlinear source term,
	f0: source strength parameter.

# Boundary Conditions #

Dirichlet boundary:
	T = 0 and u = 0 on boundary labeled as 1.

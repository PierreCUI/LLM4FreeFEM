# Problem Description #

This problem studies a steady-state thermo-elasticity process defined over a spatial domain Omega. The objective is to compute the unknown displacement field u(x) and the unknown temperature field T(x).

# Governing Equation and Variables #

The process is governed by the partial differential equations:
	Mechanical equilibrium:
		-div((E / (2 * (1 + nu))) * sigma(u) + E * nu/((1 + nu) * (1 - 2 * nu)) * div(u) * I - E / (1 - 2 * nu) * alpha * T * I) = 0 in Omega,
	Heat conduction:
		-div(k * grad(T)) = 0 in Omega,
	where:
		sigma(u) = (grad(u) + grad(u)^T) / 2.
	The problem is defined within 2 dimensions, thus x and y.

Constants:
    E: Young's modulus,
    nu: Poisson's ratio,
    alpha: thermal expansion coefficient,
    k: thermal conductivity.

# Boundary Conditions #

Dirichlet boundary:
    u = 0 on boundary for the mechanical problem labeled as 2, 4,
    T = 10 * x on boundary for the thermal problem labeled as 2, 4.

# Attention #

In this question, the mu corresponds to 2 * mu in the standard thermoelasticity formulation.

1. Constant Values
The following scalar constants are defined in the script:
	- Poisson's ratio: nu = 3.0e-1,
	- Young's modulus: E = 2.1e11,
	- thermal expansion coefficient: alpha = 1.69e-5,
	- thermal conductivity: k = 45.

2. Mesh
The computational domain is generated from a unit square discretized into 8n * n uniform subdivisions with n = 20, and with a transformation [0.35x, 0.02(y - 0.5)].

3. Space
u and T are defined within P2 space. 

4. Initial Values
T is initialized to 10 * x.

# Problem Description #

This problem considers a stationary diffusion process on a spatial domain Omega. The objective is to compute the unknown field u(x).

# Governing Equations #

The process is governed by the partial differential equation: -div(lambda(u) * grad(u)) = 1 in Omega with lambda(u) = lambda0 / (1 + u^2). The problem is defined within 2 dimensions, thus x and y.

Constants:
	lambda0: constant diffusion parameter.

# Boundary Conditions #

Dirichlet boundary:
	u = 0 on the boundary labeled as 4.

1. Constant Values
The following scalar constants are defined in the script:
	- diffusion coefficient: lambda0 = 10.

2. Mesh
The computational domain is a unit square divided into a regular grid with nn = 20 and is labeled as [1, 2, 3, 4].

3. Iteration Times
The for loop should iterate from 0 until 40. Early stop if rhs.linfty is smaller than 1e-6 and sol.linfty is smaller than 1e-5.

4. Space
u is defined within P1 space.

# Problem Description #

This problem studies a steady-state diffusion heat conduction process defined over a spatial domain Omega. The objective is to compute the spatial distribution of an unknown field T(x).

# Governing Equation and Variables #

The process is governed by the partial differential equation: -div(k * grad(T)) = f in Omega. The problem is defined within 3 dimensions, thus x, y, and z.

Constants:
	k: diffusion coefficient,
	f: volumetric source term.

# Boundary Conditions #

Dirichlet boundary:
	T = 0 on boundary labeled as 5.

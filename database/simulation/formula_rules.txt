1. A name should be given for each variable X, such as T for temperature. 
If the letter is already given in the problem, such as u, then you should use the same letter.
If you need to represent the components within space of a variable, you may use x, y, z. For example, vx, vy, vz for v.
2. The incremental variable should be named with incX, such as incT for incremental temperature.
3. The test function should be named with deltaX, such as deltaT for test in temperature.
4. In each file, you define one single varf with the name {name}Newton and {name}Residual.
5. Newton takes [incX] and [deltaX] as input. It uses incX and deltaX to form the equation.
The inputs must be within [], even if only one variable inside.
6. Residual takes [incX] and [deltaX] as input. The inputs must be within [], even if only one variable inside.
However, it uses the variable X and deltaX to form. This is a special grammar for the FreeFEM software. You must obey this.
7. For boundary conditions, you should give one condition for each term. You should not merge multiple conditions in one "on". 
8. For boundary conditions, it considers increment instead of the value. The increment can be 0 even if the value is not 0.
9. It is strictly forbidden to use "_" in FreeFEM. Always use Camel Case to name the variables and functions.
For inc and delta, you may still use incux, deltaux, to maintain the ux, instead of Ux.
10. You should write everything in one varf, instead of defining multiple funcs or reals.  
11. For complex number, the FreeFEM supports to use i directly, for example, 1 + 2i.
12. For power, the FreeFEM supports to use ^ directly, for example, X^2.
13. Please write 1.0 instead 1. and so on. You should write this in complete form.
